- __Using Flask write RESTapi to get data from mysql__

- __Issue 1:__
- get data from http: 
`@app.route('/goods/_<id>'_)`

- Can this be deployed in AWS or Heroku? so that others can get data from local database.
- Will try later


- Usage

- run:
`python3 main.py`
- Open `127.0.0.1:5000/goods` in your browser
- Open `127.0.0.1:5000/goods/id` in your browser
